= Downpour 0.0.1

Downpour is a gem to connect and query a Drizzle or MySql database using the libdrizzle library.

== TODO
* Do not maintain a list of pending queries and connections in ruby. Mark and sweep. Is this a good idea
* Actually honor some options passed in to drizzle_con_create
* Get column info and do stuff
* Create a rails plugin
* Result, Column does not have a context. Memory Leak?
